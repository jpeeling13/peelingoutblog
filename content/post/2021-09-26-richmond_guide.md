Scott's Edition is definitely worth the visit alone. The food is good and the beer selection is arguably even better. If you like tattooes you are in luck. Freshly roasted coffee greets you at every turn. Venture over to Maymont and you won't be disapointed.

> Eating various vietnamese delights - Mekong Restaurant

# Overview
The surroundings have the old industrial rebirth feel about it, new tech start-ups adjacent to classic american tattoo parlors, arcade bars and so many micro breweries you couldn't hit them all in a day if you tried. The neighborhood still has so much growth to achieve, but what's already there is precious. We've only visited 3 times so far, don't have any friends or family currently living there (or ever did) but can't help but get that homesick feeling after not being there for too long. It's just that kind of place.

# Food
Personally, we thought that Mekong definitely lived up to the hype. We got there around 6pm and were STORVING. The beer list is actually quite international, and everything on the menu was absolutely delectable. Deliciousio. Chef's kisses galore.

We love walking around at nightime and seeing the sights and stoooof.
