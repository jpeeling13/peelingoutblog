## Food
Personally, we thought that Mekong definitely lived up to the hype. We got there around 6pm and were STORVING. The beer list is actually quite international, and everything on the menu was absolutely delectable. Deliciousio. Chef's kisses galore.

We love walking around at nightime and seeing the sights and stoooof.
