![](/img/peeling_out_website_sidebar.png)  **_Josh & Bryn_** are recently aquainted vanlifers and travel bloggers. Their goal is to explore the world and discover new things about food, nature, and the humans that inhabit it.

Josh & Bryn were interested in vanlife starting as early as 2015 but didn't decide to take the plunge until August of 2020. It was over the course of a year that they worked full-time and also built out their van (Josie Frank) before selling their house and moving in full-time the fall of 2021.

They both are avid eaters and drinkers. Nothing can stop them. Be aware.
